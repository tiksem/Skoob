Penis enlargement exercises have been practiced in many Asian and African cultures for centuries.  Exercise is the most effective way to enlarge the penis with lasting results.  While stretching the penis, the tissue will elongate and add permanent length.  However, the size of a man’s heart is more important than his penis as far as most women are concerned.  Still, since size is so important to men, here are some elongation exercises that can help you make the most of your penis.  Keep in mind that width is generally more satisfying than length, but if length is what you’re after, here’s how to get it naturally.  More importantly, these exercises will not only increase the length of your penis, they’re good for you.



<h4>Penis Exercise Benefits:</h4>

Improved function of the urinary nervous system, prostate, and relief from loin pain associated with constipation and infection of the prostate
Where do I do my Penis Workout?

On the edge of a chair
With your buttocks against a table
Standing in front of a mirror
On your back, legs spread, one leg up
Note: These exercises should be done when your penis is flaccid. If you are uncircumcised, pull the foreskin back before starting.

Exercise One
Grasping the glans (head), stretch your penis upward and hold for a count of ten.  Repeat this stretch and hold in the downward position, then to the left, and finally to the right.  This exercise should be done one or two times a day for 5 minutes.

Exercise Two
Again, holding the glans, pull your penis away from your body.  Then, place the thumb of your other hand on your shaft, at the base of your penis, and press down with your thumb while lifting up with your other hand.  Hold for a 10 count.  Repeat this exercise to the right and to the left, placing your thumb on alternate sides of your penis in order to create tension.  Continue stretching—alternating between up, right, and left, but never down—for 5 minutes.  Repeat once or twice per day.

Exercise Three
Holding your penis, firmly press the skin back into your body by placing both thumbs, nails touching, over the shaft of your penis and your remaining fingers underneath for support.  Be sure not to cut off circulation to the penis.  Hold for 10 seconds then relax and repeat.  You want to maintain a continuous pump action.  The farther back the penis is held, the better your results will be.  Repeat once or twice daily for 5 minutes. This exercise can also be performed while semi-erect.

Exercise Four
Place one hand at the base of your penis and the other behind the glans. Then stretch the penis in both directions, away from the body with the hand on the glans and towards the body with the hand at the base of the penis.  Hold for 10 seconds and repeat.  Again, repeat this exercise once or twice a day for 5 minutes.

<h4>Testicular Holding</h4>
The testicles, a frequently overlooked part of the male reproductive system, are the two glands that hang behind the penis within the scrotum.  They manufacture sperm and Testosterone, as well as other male hormones.  Here are some exercises to keep your testicles nice and healthy.
 

Exercise One
Exercise One involves both the penis and the testicles.  It works best if a partner helps you.  Hold your breath for one minute, if possible, and squeeze your PC muscle (the support muscle in the genitals best identified when you stop the flow of urine) while you or your partner pulls down on your scrotum gently.  This exercise is most effective if you warm your scrotum with hot water beforehand.  Do this for 5 minutes a day.

Exercise Two
Encircle the scrotum with thumb and index or middle finger, above the testicles, then pull down and forward lightly.  Use the fingertips of your other hand to gently, but firmly, massage the testicles and scrotal contents for 30 seconds.  Repeat for a total of 5 minutes once or twice per day.

Exercise Three
Lift your testicles upwards and hold against the body for 10 seconds.  When done properly, your penis should be pressed against your stomach. Then release, relax, and repeat.  Your goal is to work up to six minutes of repetitions once or twice a day.

<h4>Penis Health</h4>
In general, the following tips will help you and your penis stay healthy:
 
Average 3 erections and 2 orgasms per week in order to make sure your penis is getting the oxygen it needs.
Get enough sleep, relax, and reduce your stress level.
Eat your vegetables, drink plenty of water, and reduce your fat intake.
Exercise regularly!

Jelqing warm up (Step 1)
Jelqing for Penis Length (Step 2)
Jelqing for Penis Girth (Step 3)

A WORD ABOUT EJACULATION AND EXERCISE
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Most men seeking to enlarge their penis, or overcome impotence generally will use pills or medical devices. For this reason we have also included information regarding Penis Enlargement Pills and Penis Vacuum Devices.

JELQING

Penis enlargement exercises are commonly referred to as jelqing. The term is said to have originated in Arabia where fathers preparing their sons for sexual relationships would use massage to increase the size of the penis. The renowned technique of jelqing or milking can achieve the most extreme results when used in combination with potent sexual enhancing products. Over time, the combination can significantly increase the length and girth of the penis.

PENIS ENLARGEMENT EXERCISE
JELQING WARM UP (“BIG 10” Step 1)

You penis is made up in part of spongy tissues called the spongiosum. Spongiosum tissue may be manipulated to hold more blood thereby becoming enlarged. The concept is that by routinely using this technique (called Jelqing) eventually the penis will become larger whether flaccid or erect.

Jelqing workouts are based around a daily workout of around 20-30 minutes. The simplest way to warm up for Jelqing is to take a hot shower. However, if this is not desirable or possible, then you may manually warm your penis by wrapping it in a warm (not too hot) wash cloth for about 5 minutes. The idea is to increase the blood flow to your penis. This will improve the effectiveness of the Jelqing exercises. Once completed, the jelq techniques can be commenced.

To avoid injury, Jelqing should never be practiced while the penis if fully erect. However, to be effective, the penis should be semi-erect (50-75%) for Jelqing.

JELQING FOR PENIS LENGTH (“BIG 10” Step 2)

After ‘warming up’ your penis as described above, its time to add lubricant to the process. Apply a moderate amount of lubricant and work your penis to a semi-erect state. Then grip your penis at the base with your thumb and forefinger (like you are making the hand sign for O.K.). Squeeze firmly enough to delay most (not all) of the blood from flowing out of your penis. You should not have any pain or discomfort. If you do, relax your grip.

Using your other hand, grip your penis in the same manner just above your first grip and begin a slow, stroking motion to push blood into the head of your penis. Continue the process for 5 minutes. Remember to keep your penis semi-erect during the entire process. If you become fully aroused STOP until your erection subsides. Or, if you lose your erection, stimulate yourself until you are semi-erect.

Jelqing for penis length is a once a day exercise. Do not think that more is better. Once a day only, 5 days a week.

JELQING FOR PENIS GIRTH (“BIG 10 Step 3)

After ‘warming up’ your penis, you are ready for Jelqing for penis girth. Like the jelqing technique for penis length, applying lubricant is advised. First you need to achieve a semi-erect penis. Then, using the same “O.K.” grip as described in jelqing for penis length, squeeze your penis at its base firmly enough to restrict blood flow out of the penis. Again, you should not have any discomfort. Now use your free hand to grip (again in the O.K. manner) the penis shaft just below the head. Slowly stroke your penis downward toward the base and try to squeeze the blood outward to the sides of the shaft. After a few seconds restart the process about an inch further down the shaft. Continue down until you reach the base.

Jelqing for penis girth is a once a day exercise. Once a day, 5 days a week.

FLACCID PENIS STRETCHING (“BIG 10” Steps 4-6)

Your penis actually begins inside your body. Your penis is suspended from the pubic bone by a series of ligaments. When you account for this, as much as one half of your penis is inside you body. Like all the ligaments in your body, these have a tendency to become less elastic and stretch out over time. The result is that more of your ‘internal’ penis becomes exposed. Penis enlargement surgery is designed to lengthen your penis by severing these ligaments so that more of your penis is exposed. But without resorting to surgery, you can naturally manipulate these ligaments to lengthen your penis.

Before you begin remember that this exercise should not cause you any pain. If you are caused any pain you are simply going too hard. Be gentle- the idea is to stretch, not yank or tear.

Begin by taking the base of your flaccid penis in your hand and gently pulling it straight out so that the ligament at the base are slowly stretched. A slow, gentle, gradual pull is best. Remember-no pain! Hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds. Then release and rest for at least 15 more seconds. Repeat this stretch 3 times. You may do this up to 3 times a day, 5 days per week. Each repetition counts as a step in our “BIG 10” program. So the first rep is step 4, 2nd rep is step 5 and 3rd rep is step 6.

ERECT PENIS STRETCHING (“BIG 10” Steps 7-9)

Before you begin remember that this exercise should not cause you any pain. If you are caused any pain you are simply going too hard. Be gentle- the idea is to stretch, not pull or tear.

Achieve a full erection to begin this exercise. Then, in a gentle manner, pull your penis to the right for 5 seconds for a comfortable stretch. Repeat the procedure by stretching to the left for 5 second and then straight forward for 5 seconds. Pause to rest for 20-30 seconds and repeat the entire sequence 3 times. Be sure to maintain a full erection for each exercise. Once per day, 5 days per week should do it for the erect penis stretching.

KEGEL EXERCISE (“BIG 10” Step 10)

The Kegel exercise is designed to strengthen the pubococcygeal muscle. For this reason this technique is sometimes referred to as the PC exercise. Strengthening the PC muscle can result in stronger erections with greater control of ejaculation. Often the result is more intense orgasms. The PC muscle really refers to a group of muscles that, in addition to sexual function, are used in the waste process (urination and deficating). This dual use for the PC muscle makes exercising very easy. If you have ever tried to stop urinating in midstream, you have already discovered just where your PC muscle is. Don’t worry, you do not need to be urinating to complete this exercise. However, we suggest that you try to stop urinating in midstream at least once in order to experience the muscle sensation involved with the Kegel exercise. This will help you to locate and constrict your PC muscle.

Once you have determined how to flex you PC muscle, squeeze and hold it for 10 seconds. Release and rest for another 10 seconds. Repeat as often as possible up to 10 times per day. 5 days a week.

A WORD ABOUT EJACULATION AND EXERCISE
These exercises are designed to help you reach your penis enlargement goals. Increasing blood flow to the penis is essential. Because of the drop in testosterone levels after ejaculation, blood flow to the penis is reduced and much of the benefit of your exercises along with it. Therefore, ejaculation (or even masturbation with a couple of hours after your penis enlargement exercises) should be avoided. However, if you are unable to control your ejaculation, you may offset this blood flow issue by taking a natural herbal supplement.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like any exercise regiment, overdoing things can cause soreness. If you are stretching your penis too hard or too far or too often, redness and soreness are possible. If you experience such problems immediately stop your penis enlargement workouts until you are fully healed.

Blistering, chaffing and skin irritation may also result from the exercises. You may try more lubricant (we recommend water soluble). Here again, should you have any problems, stop the exercises until your penis is fully healed.

Be aware that a condition called ecchymosis is also possible. Ecchymosis refers to bruising or broken capillaries. Too much pressure during your workout can bring on this condition. Again, if this occurs, immediately stop all exercises until you are completely healed.
